### Problem Statement Template

```
[User Persona] experiences [Pain Points] because [Root Causes].

How might we help them [Desired Outcome] so that [Measurable Success Criteria]?
```

**Example (Thirsty Crow)**:
> Kavi the Crow experiences frustration accessing water from narrow containers because his beak can't reach below 15cm.
